# Constellation Tucana

*Constellation* is a flexible many-to-many remote control project, aiming for a funtionality similar to that of macro keyboards over network. 
*Tucana* is a baseline *Actor* implementation that is being used to develop a proof of concept. It will be *hopefully* replaced with crossplatform solution at a later stage.

**Current State:** Initial Protocol Development

It uses [Coaty Swift](https://github.com/coatyio/coaty-swift) and Mqtt for communication.
